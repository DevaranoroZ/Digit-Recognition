# Digit-Recognition
Trying various machine learning techniques for the digit recognition problem on Kaggle.

This is one of the problems I have started with to learn various techniques in machine learning.

# repository contents:

\sample_data_4000..........................	: contains the first 4000 entries from the training data given on kaggle

\NeuralNetwork_Tutorial....................	: contains the code files to load data, run simple neural net and SVM    

\NeuralNetwork_Tutorial\DR_load_data.py    	: for loading the data and modifying it to meet the requirements for the nerual network code

\NeuralNetwork_Tutorial\SVM_baseline.py    	: to model the data using SVM in order to establish a baseline performance

\NeuralNetwork_Tutorial\network.py         	: to model the data using neural net
